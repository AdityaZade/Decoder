# QuantumDecoder
A Simple intensive implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm using Qiskit and basic Quantum Cryptography




<h5> How it is useful</h5>
The above dark box in the example could be consider as anything an encrypted messaage and our algorithmn acts here as a decrypter and a really fast one!!
Currently we do have not achieved enough computing power to breakdown a hash function. But it is just a matter of time as Quantum computing is progrssing very fastly.

solution for this is using Quantum teleportaion for our comunication n induced with Quantum enatanglement
